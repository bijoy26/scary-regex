4.1 PEER ASSESSMENT SCORE
University of Pennsylvania
Philadelphia, PA
#17 in Computer Science (tie)

4.1 PEER ASSESSMENT SCORE
University of Wisconsin--Madison
Madison, WI
#17 in Computer Science (tie)

4.1 PEER ASSESSMENT SCORE
Johns Hopkins University
Baltimore, MD
#20 in Computer Science (tie)

4.0 PEER ASSESSMENT SCORE
Purdue University--West Lafayette

#20 in Computer Science (tie)
```
## Step 1 : Remove "X.X PEER ASSESSMENT SCORE" Lines

## Regex

`/^[0-9]\.[0-9]/g`	

> ### 游대 Find an replace with **NULL**.

## Output

```

## Step 2: Add Comma "`,`" at the end of 1st Line

## Regex

`/(^(.)*University(.)*$)/g`

## Output

```

```
> ### 游대 Replace with "`\1,`"

## Step 3: Add Comma "`,`" at the end of 2nd Line

## Regex

`/(^(.)*, (.)*$)/g`

## Output

```

> ### 游대 Replace with "`\1,`"


---

## Step 4: Merge three lines 

## Regex

`/(^(.)*,$)\n((.)*,$)\n((.)*$)/g`

## Output

```
